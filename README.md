# Timers for GW2 Blish HUD Timers module

## Requisites
- Install Blish HUD from https://blishhud.com/
- Install the Blish HUD **Timers** Module.

## Setup
- Download the latest `haskha_timers.zip` in [releases](https://github.com/HasKha/gw2-timers/releases)
- Do not extract the zip
- Copy or move the zip to `~Documents/Guild Wars 2/addons/blishhud/timers/`
- Disable and enable the timers module, or relaunch blishhud, or relaunch gw2.

## Ura LCM timers
- Rising pressure: Shows when Rising pressure ticks up, every 8 seconds. This is fully automatic.
- Toxic geyser spawns. This is best used together with my [marker pack](https://github.com/HasKha/gw2-markers) as they use the same icons.
    - Phase 1 (100% to 70%) is fully automatic.
    - After 70%, press trigger key 0 when the toxic geyser spawns at square.
    - At 40%, press trigger key 0.

## Temple of Febe CM
- Timer will start automatically when entering combat. You must press the interaction key when the split phase add is killed in the 80% and 50% split phase.
- Mechanics are only included up to a certain point, teams should phase after those.
- Split phase mechanics are not included.
- Timers contain some annotations on mechanics, such as `Tether (Mesmer portal)`. Those are typical of the simple unit strat.
- Example (very outdated tactics): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSowQexOmGQ
